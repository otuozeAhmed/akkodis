1. b) (False)

2. This question is faulty. The function does not explicitly have a return statement
   and hence will default to return None.
   More so, your print(func) statement on line 7, will only print the memory address
   of the function. I guess this was a typo.

   However, if a return statement is added to the function, then the correct option would be d) [1]
   I would re-write question 2 as;

   def func(par: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        par = [1]
        return par
    
    lst = [0]
    print(func(lst))

3. c) (8, 9)

4. The ++ operator does not exist in Python. However, it is used explicitly in languages
   like C, C++ and Java. 

   So, the output would remian the same as initially declared.
   a) varOne=10, varTwo=10

5. The code provided is swapping the first element with the fourth and vice versa.
   b) [1, 3, 2, 4]
